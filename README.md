This app is designed to help a large segment of the people who want to set for a PCR test to see
whether they are a positive Covid-19 or not. it allows easier contact with the doctors to have a
consultation without overcrowding over the tests' lab.
This project is composed of 2 parts; one for the patients to submit their symptoms, and one for the
hospitals given with their exact locations; to help the users get there faster.
